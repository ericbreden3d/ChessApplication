Chess Application
Author: Eric Breden

Although this project is a work-in-progress, it contains all necessary gameplay logic to allow for basic multiplayer chess gameplay.
Future updates will inlcude timed gameplay, AI opponent functionality, networked/multi-windowed play, and user-customizable GUI.

This project has been created with the intent of gaining experience working with inheritance hierarchies and complex object relationships.
To this end, a near-total refactoring of the codebase is in the works in order to reflect a more sensible and clean display of
good object-oriented design. Currently, most of the game logic and program flow is located in the ChessBoard class and in each of
the ChessPece interface's implementing classes.

To view the source code, please refer to the directory of .java files located in ~\src\main\java\ChessPackage.

To run the program:
- download the executable JAR file in the root directory
- Via the command line, type "java -jar Chess-1.0.0.jar"
